\maketitle

The goal of this note is to introduce certain basic concepts of category theory, in a context which will hopefuly make them understandable to people with a background in statistics or similar fields.

There are already several excellent books introducing category theory at an elementary level. I will mention, one, Riehl's \emph{Categories in Context}.
It is an excellent supplement or replacement for these notes, and available for free on the author's webpage.
